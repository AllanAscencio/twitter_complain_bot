# Twitter Complain Bot

Twitter Complain Bot

Automated bot that checks your internet download speed and upload speed from https://www.speedtest.net/ and compares those numbers against the ones I had in my contract, if the speeds are below from what they offered it opens twitter, logs in and tweets a complain against the company.

This application is installable locally in desktop.

## Built With

- Python
- Selenium

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup

- Open the console
- Download or git clone https://github.com/AllanAscencio/twitter_complain_bot
- cd twitter_complain_bot

## Install Selenium:
Use pip to install the selenium package. Python 3 has pip available in the standard library. Using pip, you can install selenium like this:

```
  pip install selenium
```

You may consider using virtualenv to create isolated Python environments. Python 3 has venv which is almost the same as virtualenv.

You can also download Python bindings for Selenium from the [PyPI page for selenium package](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/). and install manually.

If you need further documentation you can head to https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

After Selenium is perfectly installed you should be able to run the code properly.

## Considerations

- Remember that webpages like twitter may change the paths of the buttons of the log in, in which case is necessary to know the exact Xpath in order to change it in the code.
